# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
----
## Project Overview
Pewlett Hackard wants to plan ahead by identifying employees who soon may be looking at retirement, and plan to roll out a program for potential future retirees. Having such a large amount of employees (over 300,000), PH has enlisted my help to determine potential retirees, as well as employees that will be eligle to participate in the company's mentoriship program.
To get this requested data we utilized several datasets provided by PH, with these data sets we needed to gather te following:
- Employees eligible for retirement (Employees born between 1/1/53 - 1/31/55)
- Employees eligible for the mentorship program (Employees born in 1965)

## Project Results
The below shows code created to generate a table showing all unique employees eligible for retirement.

Utilizing the data from the above, we were able to generate a table showing a count of total employees eligible for retirement by department.

The below image will provide the code we utilized to gather our information necessary to identify those employees eligible for the new mentorship program.

## Summary of Analysis
We identified over 90,000 employees who are currently eligible for retirement, but only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. Reviewing the retirees by title table mentioned above, we can identify a large majority of these potential retiree's within senior roles (Senior Engineer & Senior Staff). Now that this information in known, I would recommend geting ahead of this potentially large loss of company experience and knowledge by looking to provide another program to hire & train employees to better plan and avoid a large turnover in such crucial roles. Whilst we are planning ahead, we may also want to broaden our eligibility for the mentorship program, it would be beneficial for the company to get ahead of our future retiree's and rataining as much knowledge as possible. 1,549 employees would be a drop in the bucket now that we know our total of 90,398 potential retirees.
