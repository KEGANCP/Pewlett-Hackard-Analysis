# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
----
## Project Overview
Pewlett Hackard wants to plan ahead by identifying employees who soon may be looking at retirement, and plan to roll out a program for potential future retirees. Having such a large amount of employees (over 300,000), PH has enlisted my help to determine potential retirees, as well as employees that will be eligle to participate in the company's mentoriship program.
To get this requested data we utilized several dataset provided by PH, with these data sets we needed to gather te following:
- Employees eligible for retirement (Employees born between 1/1/53 - 1/31/55)
- Employees eligible for the mentorship program (Employees born in 1965)
